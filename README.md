# zanaty-password-generator
I created an app to randomly create a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button, a new passwork is generated after I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
I'll be prompted for password criteria then I'll select which criteria to include in the password
I'm also prompted for the length of the password then I'll be able to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
when I'm asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
WHEN I answer each prompt, my input will be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
All prompts are answered and a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
The password will be generated and is either displayed in an alert or written to the page!
